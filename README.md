YouTube Video Search and Analytics is a Python script that allows users to search for YouTube videos related to a specific query, published within a certain number of days. The script then extracts the titles and channel names for the top five videos with the highest number of views that contain at least two Polish words in the title, and displays the view count along with the title and channel name. This script requires a YouTube API key to run.
